# Ti Expansion Files Android Module

The Titanium Expansion Files module allows taking advantage of the [APK Expansion Files](http://developer.android.com/google/play/expansion-files.html) feature provided by the Android Play Store in Titanium Mobile applications.

The module uses Google's Licensing and Downloader libraries distributed as Extras within the Android SDK install.

This repository contains the following:

* `downloader_library`: the Google Downloader library source code and .jar
* `licensing_library`: the Google Licensing library source code and .jar
* `tiexpansionfiles`: the Titanium/Android native module
* `tiexpansiontest`: a Titanium mobile (classic) test application

For additional information on the module, please refer to the `README.md` file contained in the `tiexpansionfiles` project directory.
